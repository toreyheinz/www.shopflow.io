Looking forward to presenting: Scheduling your Shop with a Digital Job Board at MFA Marine Workshop

What is a digital job board, and why even bother?

A digital job board is a way to organize and display jobs so that you can streamline your shop and escape the chaos! Find out if you are ready to get started, as we follow a simple workflow from start to finish, dig into the details of a complicated job, and discuss how to implement a digital job board to maximize your throughput.
