title: Adding more columns to the cards table view.

Shopflow has two main ways to view cards: as columns or in a table. The table view is great, but as more requests came in for more columns we needed a way to toggle which columns are displayed.

Once you find the set of columns you like Shopflow will remember them the next time you view the cards table.

The Currently available columns are:<br>
__Contacts:__ A comma separated list of contacts from the card details section<br>
__Tags:__ A list of tags currently applied the card<br>
__Area:__ Where is the work being preformed<br>
__Stage:__ The card's current stage and the numbers of days in that stage<br>
__Card Owner:__ Who is responsible for this card at top level<br>
__Started:__ Date the card/job was started<br>
__Due Date:__ Date the card is due<br>
__Updated:__ When was time last time this card was saved<br>
__*Hours:__ How many actual/planned hours does this card have

__\*__ Not all of these columns are available for every account.
